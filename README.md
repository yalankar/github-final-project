# Simple Interest Calculation

## 📘 Overview
Simple Interest (SI) is a basic method of calculating interest on a principal amount over a period of time. It is commonly used in short-term loans, savings accounts, and quick financial estimations.

This README provides formulas, examples, and explanations.

## 🧮 Formula
```
Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100
```
- **P** = Principal amount
- **R** = Rate of interest (% per year)
- **T** = Time (in years)

```
Total Amount (A) = P + SI
```

## 🔍 Explanation of Terms
### Principal (P)
The base amount invested or borrowed.

### Rate of Interest (R)
Percentage charged or earned annually.

### Time (T)
Duration for which interest is calculated.

## 📊 Example Calculations
### Example 1
- P = ₹10,000
- R = 5%
- T = 2 years

```
SI = (10000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = ₹1,000
A = ₹11,000
```

### Example 2
- P = ₹8,000
- R = 7%
- T = 6 months (0.5 years)

```
SI = (8000 × 7 × 0.5) / 100 = ₹280
A = ₹8,280
```
